## Freelance.

**Concept** 

In Spain, a self-employed worker (not to be confused with individual entrepreneur or entrepreneur) is a natural person who carries out an economic activity without an employment contract.

**Incomes**

The freelancer will generally send an invoice to charge for his services.
The times of issuance, concepts and payment terms should be reflected in the contract and on the invoice.
The incomes will be subject to taxation, generally personal income tax and VAT, If the company that hires the freelance is a third state outside of the European Union, special care must be taken with VAT, because it could be exempt, or there could be a reversal of the taxable person.

**To insure common and occupational risks**

It is a common practice to contract a private insurance policy for sick leave, temporary or permanente disability or in case of an emergency that prevents you from continuing to work.

**Common Clauses**

In the field of IT consulting there are clauses that are present in most contracts that bind the freelancer and the company, these are:

* **NDA** deal with the confidentiality of information and what can or cannot be said about the work developed for the contracting company.
* **Non-competition**: by which the freelancer is prevented from providing services directly or indirectly that may converge with the contracting company's market for a certain period of time, usually 2 years.
* **Non-solicitation:** whereby the freelancer must refrain from soliciting work from other employees, suppliers or clients of the contracting company.
* **Intellectual property:** essential clause, the companies usually ask for the rights on computer developments made by the freelancer, it is necessary to be careful with the limitation of the terms and that they refer only to those made by the order of the company.
* **Data protection:** In Europe they usually include a data protection clause to subject it to the RGPD.

**Termination**
 There are several ways to terminate a contract. One of them depends on the essence of the contract and the others on the will of the parties. 
 
 On the one hand, we have the nullity: when certain circumstances are given, the contract can be declared null and void. 
 On the second hand, within the will of the parties we find the following reasons for termination of contracts: 
- Mutual cancellation. Both parties decide to terminate the contract. This form is not included as such in the Spanish Civil Code. 
- Termination of contracts 
- Contractual termination 

**unemployment insurance**

If the freelance ceases the activity involuntarily and ccan justify this involuntariness, the freelance worker could have access to an unemployment benefit, trough the Spanish social security system.

## Make your activity profitable

When you are a freelance you have to take into account several factors to make your activity profitable:
- **Fixed costs**

Those that you need to worK, for example, electricity, internet, telephone, etc.
- **Salary**

yes, it is different from what you can earn in general for your work. Basically, it would be the cost of having trained and worked your knowledge and skills.
- **Benefits**

What you earn once yo have paid the fixed cost and your salary.

To all this you would have yo add a savings base, for example if you want to sabe 300€ per month add it to the budget.
A basis of amortizations "if my laptop doesn't work, I should have the capacitu to buy a new one without sweathing" So if the PC lasts 2 years, divide the cost of a new one with similar characteristiucs and so, if you have to renew your PC, you'll be able to do it easily.

All of this will give you a rather "high" sum, but don't worry, that's where the pricing strategy starts.

Let's imagine that you want to earn 2000€ per month as your salary, and you have 1000€ as fixed costs, also, you want to save 3000€ and the starting price to buy a new laptop is, let's say, 50€ per month.
That means that you will have to earn 3350€ each month to have cover the basics, and everything you earn from there will be benefits.

To reach this amount you could have one client that pays you 3500€ for example, or you can split this amount between two or three clients.

If the numbers don't add up, you should recalculate the strategy, like getting more clients, rising prices or cut back on expenses.

# Some tricks.

- Invoice 50% in advance.
- Make a playment plan for the customer.
- Make an economic plan.

## Payments term

In the software development field there are different payment terms:
- By hour.

Once you have calculated the amount you'll need to pay the fixed cost, your salary and your savigns base and your basis for amortizations, you can set a fixed price for a unit of time.

* **Pros**: It is simple because it is clear to the client that you'll charge for the time you spent in his commission.
* **Cons**: It is complex because estimates are usually unrealistic. Each subject is different and the knowledge it requires is different, becaus you have to justify all that time.
* **Cons**: Iy limits you when it comes to "selling" those units, since they are finite (8 hours per day).

Justifying the time: There are several methods, like you'll have to write 200 lines of code, as they have calculated that those 200 lines are more or less developed in 8 hours. Or to be online on an APP during your work session.

In some contracts, the client establishes that the maximum number of hours it will pay for is 40 per week, as if it were a day's work for a contracted worker.

In such a case, do not work extra hours, use that time to disconnect and refresh yourself.

If you are going to use this payment term, remember to set a clear way to calculate the hours you'll spend in the project in the contract.

- By project.

With your activity's numbers on mind you'll need to know how big is the project and if it going to consume all your working hours or if you will be able to get more than one client at the same time.

Think about the projects and the information you'll need to calculate how big or how small the project is. Once you have work out the information you are looking for, develop a questionnaire that collects it efficiently.

* **Pros**: It gives to the client peace of mind because he or she will know what is facing.
* **Cons**: to difficult to calculate without previous experience in the matter. 
You can change references like the competitors price (don't push down your price to compete, it would damage all the sector) scales, what your lawyers charges mutiplied by 1.3
* **Cons**: If you set yourself in a range of money it will be difficult to "raise" it later.
Try to start with highers prices and learn how to sell your skills, it's more important to seem confident than being confident.


If you opt for this payment term, perhaps a system of ranges (I make this kind of projects from 3000€ to 1000€ -a little trick here, if you say the lower price after the higher price the client will feel more relief and will think that your services are payable) will help you and adjust according to the subject and the client.

- Mixed: by hour and by milestones.

Combines both forms of work, in such a way that you are paid by the hour, with the agreed control of hours, and when you reach certain points, the milestones, you get a bonus, as if it were a project.

If you opt for this formula, keep in mind what has been said about working by the hour and, in addition, add a clear and specific roadmap for the development of the project.

- Your data: Name, lastname, address, NIF or CIF, phone, email.
