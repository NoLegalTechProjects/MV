## Freelance.

**Concept** 

In Spain, a self-employed worker (not to be confused with individual entrepreneur or entrepreneur) is a natural person who carries out an economic activity without an employment contract.

**Incomes**

The freelancer will generally send an invoice to charge for his services.
The times of issuance, concepts and payment terms should be reflected in the contract and on the invoice.
The incomes will be subject to taxation, generally personal income tax and VAT, If the company that hires the freelance is a third state outside of the European Union, special care must be taken with VAT, because it could be exempt, or there could be a reversal of the taxable person.

**Common Clauses**

* **Non-solicitation:** whereby the freelancer must refrain from soliciting work from other employees, suppliers or clients of the contracting company.
* **Intellectual property:** essential clause, the companies usually ask for the rights on computer developments made by the freelancer, it is necessary to be careful with the limitation of the terms and that they refer only to those made by the order of the company.
* **Data protection:** In Europe they usually include a data protection clause to subject it to the RGPD.

**Termination**
 There are several ways to terminate a contract. One of them depends on the essence of the contract and the others on the will of the parties. 
 
 On the one hand, we have the nullity: when certain circumstances are given, the contract can be declared null and void. 
 On the second hand, within the will of the parties we find the following reasons for termination of contracts: 
- Mutual cancellation. Both parties decide to terminate the contract. This form is not included as such in the Spanish Civil Code. 
- Termination of contracts 
- Contractual termination
